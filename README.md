# opcache-json

[![](https://travis-ci.org/stevencorona/opcache-json.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stevencorona/opcache-json)

PHP 5.5 is awesome. It's fast, more modern, and has a bunch of great features. One of those new, awesome features is that it gets bundled with Zend Opcache by default— no more APC! Hooray!

But this win brings some new burden. Zend Opcache has a TON of configuration settings and monitoring them is not that easy. The default output is a little bit clunky and wasn't really designed with modern devops in mind.

## Designed for Modern Devops
This library was designed to solve that problem. It cleans up Zend Opcache's internal stats and makes it easily grabbable as JSON, which your app can choose to expose to an internal HTTP endpoint. Opcache-json also exposes this data to statsd, which you can use to view historical cache data and watch trends.

## Getting Started
The best way to install it is to use Composer and add the following to your project's `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "stevencorona/opcache-json": "*"
    }
}
```
    
## Basic Usage

```php
// By default Statsd output is disabled
// $opcache = new Opcache\Status;

// Or pass in Statsd config with an array
// $opcache = new Opcache\Status(["host" => "localhost", "port" => "8125"]);

// Or configure the Statsd connection with a block
$opcache = new Opcache\Status(function() {

  $c   = new \Domnikl\Statsd\Connection\UdpSocket("127.0.0.1", "8125");
  return new \Domnikl\Statsd\Client($c, "opcache");

});

echo $opcache->status(true);
```

## Statsd Output

Statsd output comes stock. Just configure your connection by passing a block or an array to the `Opcache\Status` constructor. The following keys are sent as gauge values to Statsd:

```
opcache.used_memory:5593056|g
opcache.free_memory:61515808|g
opcache.wasted_memory:0|g
opcache.current_wasted_percentage:0|g
opcache.num_cached_scripts:11|g
opcache.num_cached_keys:13|g
opcache.max_cached_keys:3907|g
opcache.hits:33|g
opcache.start_time:1396011952|g
opcache.last_restart_time:0|g
opcache.oom_restarts:0|g
opcache.hash_restarts:0|g
opcache.manual_restarts:0|g
opcache.misses:11|g
opcache.blacklist_misses:0|g
opcache.blacklist_miss_ratio:0|g
opcache.opcache_hit_rate:75|g
```

> **Hint:** If you have a multi-server or multi-worker environment (hint: most of us do), you probably want to add your server hostname and PHP PID to the key namespace.

## Extra stats

If you want to send extra stats about state of Opcache, meaning one of the following metrics:

```
opcache.opcache_enabled|1|g
opcache.cache_full|0|g
opcache.restart_pending|0|g
opcache.restart_in_progress|0|g
```

You can do it by calling Opcache\Status->send_extra_stats() method before calling status():

```php
$opcache->send_extra_stats(array (
  'opcache_enabled'     => true,
  'cache_full'          => true,
));
```

## How to run this in production

The obvious, but less than elegant, way might be embed this library into your application and create an endpoint. Workable, but not so clean.

Here's a better way to do it, if you're using PHP-FPM. First, you need to install the `cgi-fcgi` utility (it's in the ubuntu package `apt-get install libfcgi0ldbl`).

Next, clone this repository to somewhere on your server. For this demo, we'll pretend that it's in `/tmp/opcache-json`. I'll also assume that your PHP-FPM pool is running on `127.0.0.1:9000`. Now, here's the trick:

    SCRIPT_NAME=/example.php \
    SCRIPT_FILENAME=/tmp/opcache-json/example.php \
    REQUEST_METHOD=GET \
    cgi-fcgi -bind -connect 127.0.0.1:9000

That will return the JSON status of your running PHP-FPM pool back to you. You can put it into a cron or something and automatically monitor it without having to pollute your running application with this code.

## JSON Output
The JSON output is easy to ready and can be exposed as an internal HTTP endpoint, which can be consumed by human eyes or a monitoring systems. It's pretty straightforward— the output looks like this</p>

## Running the tests

You **must** enable `opcache.enable_cli` to run the tests. PHP must be built with Zend Opcache.

```
$ composer install
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit -d opcache.enable_cli=1 tests/Opcache.php
```
